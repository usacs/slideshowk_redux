# Slideshowk Project Description
## by Ez Ablaza


# Goal:
To recreate the public speaking game "slideshow karaoke", which is widely popular at hackathons and other events. 

# How to Play:
There are two roles:
1. Presenter(s):
	+ Your goal is to present a slide deck that no one has ever seen before.  You (and your partner, if applicable) are to 
	*sell* this presentation.  Make believe you're a TED speaker, and that you wrote this slide deck weeks in advance.  
	+ Do your absolute best to not get thrown off.  Expect the unexpected.   
2. Controller:
	+ Your goal is to throw off the presenter(s).  You don't have a lot of ways to do this.  The first is by topic choice - come up with a 
	random, but simple topic to seed the slide generator.  The second is by speed - you control the tempo.  Mix up long awkward pauses and quick slide
	changes to throw off your presenter's rhythm.
Everyone's role is to have fun and have a lot of laughs - trust me, the larger the crowd, the funnier this gets.  Keep it clean.  Think on the fly.
