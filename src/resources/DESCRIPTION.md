# Slideshow Karaoke Redux
### by TresTres


# Goal:
To recreate the public speaking game "slideshow karaoke" or "battle decks", a widely popular game at hackathons, icebreakers, and other events.

# How to Play:
There are two roles:   

1. Presenter(s):
   - Your goal is to present a slide deck that no one has ever seen before.  You (and your partner, if applicable) are to
   *sell* this presentation.  Make believe you're a TED speaker, and that you wrote this slide deck weeks in advance.
   - Do your absolute best to not get thrown off.  Expect the unexpected.

2. Controller:
   - Your goal is to throw off the presenter(s).  You don't have a lot of ways to do this.  The first is by topic choice - come up with a
   random, but simple topic to seed the slide generator.  The second is by speed - you control the tempo.  Mix up long awkward pauses and quick slide
   changes to throw off your presenter's rhythm.


_**Everyone**_'s role is to have fun and have a lot of laughs - trust me, the larger the crowd, the funnier this gets.  Keep it clean.  Think on the fly.

# Directions:
Simply click Start, enter a Presentation "topic", select the number of slides, and Submit!  You may use arrow keys to navigate.  Playing full-screen
with a projector is highly recommended.
